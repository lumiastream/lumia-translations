# AGENTS Instructions

## Translation Policy
- Every new translation key must be added to all locale files in `src/translations`.
- For new keys, each locale file must contain a translation in that locale (not English placeholder text), except `en` which uses English.
- Supported locales: `ar`, `de`, `en`, `es`, `fr`, `nl`, `pt`, `sv`, `tr`, `zh`.
- When updating wording, keep all locale files aligned to the same meaning.
